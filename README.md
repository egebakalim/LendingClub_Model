The Data

We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. 
It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

Our Goal

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether the borrower defaulted (charge-off), 
we are building a model that can predict whether a borrower will pay back their loan? 
This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether they are likely to pay back the loan.
